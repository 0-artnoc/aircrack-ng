Installing
----------

This version now require more libraries than 0.X versions to be compiled. 
See INSTALLING file for more information

OpenWrt Devices
---------------

You can use airodump-ng on OpenWrt devices. You'll have to use specify
prism0 as interface. Airodump-ng will automatically create it.
Rq: Aireplay DOESN'T work on OpenWrt with broadcom chipset since the driver doesn't support injection


Other issue:
------------

Problem: Airodump-ng stop working after some time
Solution: You may have a network manager running that puts back the card in managed mode. 
          You'll have to disable it (the fastest solution is killing the process) then restart airodump-ng.


Madwifi-ng known bugs:
----------------------

Problem: When changing rate while you are capturing packet makes airodump-ng stall
Solution: Restart airodump-ng or change rate before starting it

Problem: After some time it stops capturing packets and you're really sure no network manager are running at all.
Solution: That's a known bug in the driver, it may happen at any time
          (I saw that at 5 minutes for someone and at 50 for someone else, it can even be more).

Problem: When creating a new VAP airodump-ng takes up to 10-15 seconds to see the first packet
Solution: It's the behaviour of madwifi-ng, don't worry.

Problem: Wesside-ng doesn't work
Solution: There's a bug in madwifi-ng subversion (in trunk), try using latest stable release (0.9.3.2).

Orinoco bugs
------------

Problem: BSSID is not reported correctly or is 00:00:00:00:00:00 or signal is not reported correctly.
Solution: These are known bugs and we'll work on it for 1.0 beta2
