About
------

    Airoscript is a complete text user interface for aircrack-ng.
    It gives you almost all functionality that aircrack-ng has, allowing you to
    save some time from writting commands.
    Writing commands may be good to learn how does it work, but repeatedly doing
    so can damage your mind and your body.

Usage
-----

    Just launch airoscript as described in syntax. 

Syntax
------

	airoscript [TERMINAL]
    where terminal is one of xterm,urxvt,gnome-terminal and screen

    Help and feedback is greatly appreciated.

Compliance
----------

    In the wrong hands, airoscript and aircrack-ng could easily violate the 
    government certification of your radio.  A simple example is running injection
    on frequencies your radio isn't certified for in your geographic region.
    you and only you are responsible for making sure that your tools -- including
    airoscript -- are compliant with the regulations in your country and region.

Bugs and feature requests
-------------------------

    Please submit bugs in aircrack-ng trac or aircrack-ng oficial forum "airoscript
    support" subforum.

Deps
-----

    Airoscript-ng currently depends on:
        xterm
        macchanger
        iw
        aircrack-ng (currently not available on debian squeeze, download it from sid or compile it yourself)
        mdk3 (http://homepages.tu-darmstadt.de/~p_larbig/wlan/) # For mdk3 support
        digenpy (http://github.com/XayOn/digenpy) # Only required for dictionary generation on WLAN_XX and Jazztel_XX
            - python 2.6 ^ (not necesary if you don't want digenpy)


    To do an easy install in debian sid (without dictionary generators or mdk3):
        # apt-get install xterm macchanger iw aircrack-ng
        # make
