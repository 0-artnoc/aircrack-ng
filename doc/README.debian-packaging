If you're planning to package this for debian-based distos you should know:
Depends: xterm|screen , gawk, aircrack-ng, macchanger
Build-Deps: debhelper ... 
Build-Deps-Indep: gettext

Makefile should be called as "make debian-packaging" and you have to change PREF var on makefile from /usr/local to /usr .
Anyway, a single line changed on makefile, and a rules file calling make with "debian-packaging" option should be everything.
I'm not really sure how will be installing docs, because they are mostly html and there is a license file (that, on debian, can be safely removed since its a gpl-2 copy). Manpage is also installed by make :-)
Note this is a script, and should be threated like that
