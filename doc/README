-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT:
Airoscript is a shell script designed to ease the use of aircrack-ng. It allows
you to: scan, select and attack any detected access point. This is done by
detecting encryption type and proposing attacks accordingly. Various attacks
are available, such as: chopchop, fragmentation attack, fakeauth, deauth,
dictionnary attacks and WPA cracking.

REQUIREMENTS:
aircrack-ng version 1.0.2
WORKING injection capable driver for the interface you want to use

STATUS:
Airoscript is currently in an unstable state.

USAGE:
Before doing anything make sure to open airoscript config file
and set all variable according to your environnement. (Not necesary yet)

The most important variables are:

# The TROUBLESHOOTING debug mod (1 for enable, 0 for disable)
DEBUG="0"

# The critical troubleshooting debug mode: uncomment or add this line to your conffile:
CDCMD="echo "
# This will make every terminal command to be showed up instead of executing

# Your interface: wlan0, ath0 etc... (if not set airoscript will ask for one
at every launch of it)
WIFI=""

If installing from sources, and you don't want to install it (you should be root
to execute aircrack, anyway), you'll need to adapt FUNCTIONS var on your config file
(you can put it on your home dir as .airoscript.conf) and make airoscript.sh executable.
( executing "chmod +x airoscript.sh" )

be sure to have root access and then you can run it by typing:
"./airoscript.sh"

COMPILATION:
a shell script doesnt need to be compiled, but it can be put into bin folder
to allow it to be run from anywhere.
There is a makefile to make this way easier:
	# make
Of course, as root. =)

Airoscript have few dependences:
Compile-time: gettext
Execute-time:   Terminal emulator (mrxvt, xterm...) -> Preferibly xterm
		Aircrack-ng > 1.0.2
		Bash
		wlandecrypter (optional)
		mdk (optional)
		GNU Tools like grep awk...
		macchanger

DEVELOPERS:
Help and feedback is greatly appreciated. 
Please feel free to mail daouid at daouid@gmail.com 
or XayOn at thexayon@gmail.com for any suggestion or correction.
I will be pleased to add you to the contributors of airoscript.

KNOWN ISSUES:
Warning messages when using XTERM

ABOUT COMPLIANCE:
In the wrong hands, airoscript and aircrack-ng could easily violate the 
government certification of your radio.  A simple example is running injection
on frequencies your radio isn't certified for in your geographic region.

you and only you are responsible for making sure that your tools -- including
airoscript -- are compliant with the regulations in your country and region.

BUGS & FEATURE REQUESTS:
Please submit bugs to daouid@gmail.com  
There is also forum thread in aircrack-ng official forum where you can ask 
questions, or just get updates, support etc.

TROUBLESHOOTING
