    make strip

    make install
    # If you want to use airolib-ng and co,
    # issue 'make SQLITE=true install' instead of 'make install'

   as well as a dictionnary in "test/" directory

=== Using precompiled binaries ===

Linux/BSD:
 * Use your package manager to download aircrack-ng
 
Windows:
 * Install the appropriate "monitor" driver for your card (standard drivers doesn't work for capturing data)
   See "Drivers" page on the wiki: http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=drivers and 
   Wild packet driver page: http://www.wildpackets.com/support/downloads/drivers
 * Download cygwin1.dll, msvcr70.dll, peek.dll and peek5.sys that you can find on the wiki
   download page ("more downloads..." link) and put them in the directory you extracted the
   executable files.
 * aircrack-ng suite is command line tools. So, you have to open a commandline
   (Start menu -> Run... -> cmd.exe) then use them
 * Run the executables without any parameters to have help
